## <a id="description-header"></a> Description

As a means of learning Node.js it seemed appropriate to make a README generator. Moreover, it is a practically useful program for creating README.mds for Github!

In this project Node.js and INquirer are used to create prompts that ultimately create a fully functional README.md file!



<br/>

## <a id="installation-header"></a> Installation

Installation is quick and easy! Merely clone this repository or download the ZIP files - all under the top green "Code" button on the right hand side!


<br/>

## <a id="usage-header"></a> Usage
Instructions for program usage:

1. Open the README.md-Generator folder on VS Code or Code Editor. 
1. Open integrated terminal within index.js.
1. Install dependencies using the following command prompt: ```npm i```
1. Run program by running the command prompt: ```node index.js``` 
1. After finishing the question prompts, a fully fleshed out README file will appear on the text file folders. (In VS Code, to the left.)
